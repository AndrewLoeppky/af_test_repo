# Git-Tac-Toe
This notebook is paired to a .py and myst .md file . If we do this correctly, I should be able to edit any one of them and push only the .py and .md to github, have FJ fork, edit and pull request, and I merge FJ's changes. The ideal final result is for each of us to have identical repositories containing a .ipynb (only on local repo), .py (local and remote), and .md (local and remote). Game on!

```{code-cell} ipython3
#  x  |   |
#  ___|___|___
#     |   |   
#  ___|___|___   
#     |   |   
#     |   |

print("FJ's Turn")
```
